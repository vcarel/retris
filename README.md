# Retris

A React Tetris clone

[https://vcarel.github.io/retris/](https://vcarel.github.io/retris/)

## Getting started

Checkout the project, then:

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

To build the app:

```
  yarn build
```

To serve the built locally:

```
  yarn serve
```

... but wait! because this app is deployed on Github pages, there's a prefix in all resource URLs (e.g. `/retris/static/js/2.746846e0.chunk.js` instead of `/static/js/2.746846e0.chunk.js`). To play on a local build, you have to remove the line `"homepage": "https://vcarel.github.io/retris/",` from the package.json.

_Have fun!_
